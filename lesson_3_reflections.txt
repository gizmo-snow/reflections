When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work 
local?

  Using a remote repository would be useful when collaborating with others on a project
  so that everyone is pulling from and branching off of one primary codebase that everyone
  has access to. 
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  So that you can be conscious of when changes are made to the code that you may
  be working on.  One wouldn't want an automatic pull to modify code or write overtop
  of what they'd been working on. 
  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you 
use one instead of another?

  Forks are clones of GitHub repositories that are made from one GitHub user to
  another, so that changes can be made to work not owned personally.  A clone more
  generally is a copy of a repository, either from GitHub to GitHub, or from GitHub to 
  local, or from local to local.  A branch is when a developer takes some existing work 
  that has been committed into a repo up to some point, and codes separately from the
  main/master branch.
