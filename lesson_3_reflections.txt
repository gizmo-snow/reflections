When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work 
local?

  Using a remote repository would be useful when collaborating with others on a project
  so that everyone is pulling from and branching off of one primary codebase that everyone
  has access to. 
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  So that you can be conscious of when changes are made to the code that you may
  be working on.  One wouldn't want an automatic pull to modify code or write overtop
  of what they'd been working on.
