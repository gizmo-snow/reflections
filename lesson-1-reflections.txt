How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It limited the output to only those lines that could have been affected by last update, making the auditing and comparison process much quicker


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Knowing that earlier versions are so easily accessible and the differences so clearly defined would allow some reassurance that any mistakes could be identified and mitigated in a relatively quick fashion. 


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to become more deeply involved in development, working on my own projects and collaborating with others who are working on great things.
